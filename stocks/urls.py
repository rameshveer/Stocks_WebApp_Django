The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:

Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
# Include allows urls from other apps to be included in the url patterns
from django.urls import path, include
# All the paths to all the urls for the quotes app need to point to the quotes.urls file
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("", include('quotes.urls')),
    ]
